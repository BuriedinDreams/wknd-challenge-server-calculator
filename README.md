This project is going to demonstrate my abilities to create a calculator in which a user is able to enter in two numbers of their choice and click either, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to be used to solve their math equation problem.

Additional README details can be found [here](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/readme-template/blob/master/README.md).

## Installation

For this project you need to have Node.js installed on your local machine. Once you have downloaded the project and have it opened on your preferred coding text editor. You will need to run in the terminal npm install to download all of the correct node modules for this project. Once that is finished you will need to run the command in the terminal npm "space" start. This will start the server and you will be able to open your browser of choice and in the top search bar type in --> localhost:5000 | This should then run the webpage and have it work properly. Thank you for taking the time to look at my project.
